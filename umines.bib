  abstract = {Information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines) are critical
	for overcoming information overload. A major deficiency of existing
	retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are
	not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal
	retrieval performance. For example, a tourist and a programmer may
	use the same word "Java" to search for different information, but
	the current search systems would return the same results. In this
	paper, we study how to infer a user's interest from the user's search
	context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized
	search. We present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques
	for implicit user modeling in information retrieval. We develop an
	intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that can perform
	eager implicit feedback, e.g., query expansion based on previous
	queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information.
	Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve
	search accuracy over the popular Google search engine. Copyright

	Wide Web (WWW). However, when the same query is submitted by different
	users, typical search engines return the same result regardless of
	who submitted the query. Generally, each user has different information
	needs for his/her query. Therefore, the search results should be
	adapted to users with different information needs. In this paper,
	we first propose several approaches to adapting search results according
	to each user's need for relevant information without any user effort,
	and then verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Experimental
	results show that search systems that adapt to each user's preferences
	can be achieved by constructing user profiles based on modified collaborative
	filtering with detailed analysis of user's browsing history in one
