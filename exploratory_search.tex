\subsection{Exploratory Search}
The search for information and extending one's knowledge is a built-in behaviour in humans.
Last few decades have transformed search and made it an everyday function.
It wasn't until the late 1990's until web search services began offering quick access to information and changed the ways of information seeking.
Before the Web, information search services were used mainly by academics and information professionals.
Often having a monopoly, the search system providers didn't need to focus on the user experience and had no motivation to improve the user interface.
Traditional search systems were lookup-based and as such, the query formulation was an essential stage of the search task.

Human cognition limits restrict the searcher from thinking and running several search tasks in parallel.
This means the system should be simple and support the user in pursuing the task, not adding to the cognitive load already affecting the user.
Whenever the user needs to reorganize their thoughts, it's possible the 'flow' of the search task is lost.
This so-called flow is a state of mind that the searcher has and having to set that aside might result in losing it.

The flow however, is not so important when the search task is simple.
Let's think of a simple search task: a teacher has assigned a group of students to draw a poster about a European country and the group have chosen Denmark. They want to display some facts about the country in their poster, for example the population, land area and internet top-level domain. To retrieve these facts, a simple search with keyword Denmark will suffice.
The facts can be copied from Wikipedia or the official website of Denmark to the poster.
This kind of lookup-based information retrieval model is described in Figure \ref{figure_classicIR}.

\end{figure}

After finishing the poster, the group is given a new assignment.
Their second assignment is to write a short play of any historical event that was of special importance for Denmark and then perform the play in front of the class.
This time, the information needed for completing the assignment can not be clearly defined. 
Compared to the previous assignment, it takes much more time to finish.
Estimating the needed time and effort is harder, because the goal is not as clear as it was with the previous assignment.

The students might start by reading the history of Denmark in the Wikipedia.
Along their exploration, they come upon different events and people that have had an effect in Denmark's history so they make new queries regarding the newly-found topics.
The information seeking process described here fits well in what is said of berrypicking behaviour (See Figure \ref{figure_bp}).
In berrypicking behaviour the searcher gets new ideas and new paths to follow as they browse the search results of their search query \cite{bates89}.
In the example, as the students are reading about the 10th century events in Denmark, they might get interested in Harald Bluetooth, the King of Denmark at the time, and begin searching for information about him.

\end{figure}

Bates \cite{bates89} describes the berrypicking approach as "evolving search", because during the process the desired outcome may change, as well as the query.
While studying Harald Bluetooth, the students might realize his son Sweyn Forkbeard seems even more interesting a person, since he conquered England.
The desired outcome of the search session changes from finding more about Harald to finding more about Sweyn.
With their now improved knowledge of Danish history and its kings, the students need to decide which event to depict in their play.
This requires collaboration within the group, which is typical for exploratory search activities.
As seen in Figure \ref{figure_bp}, new information results in query alterations and user thoughts.

Bates \cite{bates90} described a four-level hierarchy of search activities within berrypicking: move, tactic, stratagem and strategy.
Single physical or mental actions by the user are moves, and tactics are a combination of moves. 
Berrypicking could be described as complex combination of moves and tactics, whereas lookup-based information retrieval is a simple set of tactics and moves \cite{white09}.

After decision on the event, the group needs to gather information to be able to write a script for the play.
They have to do some research on the people involved in the selected historical event and if necessary, they must seek for information on what kind of clothes were used in the era the event took place in.
The previously used websites might lack the information they are after so the searchers have to find new sources of information and their search strategies may change.
One student might volunteer in writing the script.
The initial search will focus on the selected historical event and subsequent queries fill the gaps of information the student needs to write the script.
This iterative search behaviour is illustrated in Figure \ref{figure_IterativeVsExploratory} which describes the differences between iterative search and exploratory search.
With iterative search strategy the query gets refined and the destination is clear, whereas with exploratory search strategy the information space is visited more and there are multiple search targets.

\begin{figure}[htp] % t=top, h=here, b=bottom, p=separate page, !=place even if ugly

Figure \ref{figure_3clouds} illustrates search activities associated with lookup and exploratory search processes.
Exploratory search tasks can be characterized as either learning oriented or investigative  and they have common aspects like uncertainty, ambiguity and discovery distinguishing them from look-up oriented tasks \cite{kules09}.
The lookup activities are generally handled by lookup-based search systems.
As illustrated, the lookup is embedded in learning and investigation is connected with learning.
Lookup activities usually answer to a single question whereas exploratory searches require more involvement from the user and more functionality from the system.
The explorative strategies the users have must be supported by the search user interfaces to better involve humans in the search process.

The user interface of an exploratory search system should be designed to fulfill the needs of most of its users.
More information on what works and doesn't work can usually be collected from system evaluations.
However, evaluating exploratory search systems is difficult, because users have different starting positions.
Their knowledge of the domain varies, they are interested in different aspects of the topic and they have previously encountered different information \cite{kules08}.
